# Week 5 Test

Coding test week 5:

1. Sort the array with multiple same values in the array in an ascending order.

Input: {2,8,9,3,4,3,2,6,6,2,4,9,8}

Output: {2,2,2,3,3,4,4,6,6,8,8,9,9}

2. Say you have a string of characters. Write an algorithm to collect and return a list of all substrings such that order is maintained but characters may be skipped. So “frog” can produce fog, fg, rg, etc.
